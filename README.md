### Process & Problem Solving
My process for crating the back end really came from understanding how I wanted my users to interact with the my webpage. I knew I wanted all users even non signed-in users to view parks and pickup games. User must be authenticated in order to create and update pickup games.
### Unsolved Problems For Future Iterations
- Refactoring project to hooks to allows for dynamic update
- More map intrgrations
